## Learn Blockchain Technology
These are the few links and sources to learn about the blockchain technology. These were the ones that I found a bit effective, but there are a lot many other sources we can refer to.  You can start with some short warm-up videos to get an insight of what exactly the blockchain technology is. These will help building your interest and can urge you to learn and explore more:
- [What is open and distributed ledger and how blockchain works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93E_GzvpMA0&t=531s).
- [How does a blockchain work - Simply Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4&t=192s).

- What is a blockchain? Why blockchain? How bitcoin works under the hood? If you want the answers to these, refer to any of the below videos: 
    - [How Bitcoin Works Under the Hood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE) - 22 min video
    - [How Bitcoin Works in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jOJk30eQs)   - 5 min video

### Time to go into details..
#### Cryptography
Cryptography is one of the core concepts in building the blockchain technology. It is used to secure the messages and the information that are send across the distributed network. It is also one of the main tools used in the Proof-of-Work algorithm. 
  - To learn more about it you can refer to this [Cryptography Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) in Coursera. 
  - To learn about crytpography, blockchains, bitcoins and many other concepts in an elaborate way you can refer to these detailed [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNcSSleedtfyDuhBvOQzFzQ) on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency (12 lectures series).

#### BYO Blockchain
- Build your own blockchain in Python. Try experimenting with different ways and logic of your own for building a blockchain, implementing proof-of-work, mining transactions, etc. [Learn Blockchains by Building One](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46).
- Check this [link](https://courses.blockgeeks.com/) for different courses on many blockchain concepts.

#### Smart Contracts
Smart contract is another interesting concept in this domain. They are basically computer programs stored in the blockchain and can execute on their own. They are used to make decentralized applications, a.k.a. DApps. Get an idea of what they are:
