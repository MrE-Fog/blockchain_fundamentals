# - Making transactions
# - Mining pending transactions
# - Proof-of-work algorithm to mine the blocks and adding them in the blockchain.

#    hash: contains the hash of the block.
#    calculate_hash(): to calculate the hash of the block.
#    mine_block(): mine the block with the difficulty number.

#    mine_pending_transactions(): mine the pending/unconfirmed transactions.
#    create_transaction(): add a transaction into the list of pending transactions.
#    get_balance_of_node(): to fetch the balance of a node given its address.
